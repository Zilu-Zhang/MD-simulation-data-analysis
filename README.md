# RMSD_analysis

Several ways of calculating RMSD:
1. Divergence, where the first frame is the reference;
2. Consecutive, where two adjacent frames are compared;
3. Convergence, where the last frame is the reference;
4. Stable, where an arbitrary frame is the reference, assuming the one is in the middle region of the simulation period and could be a stable conformation.
